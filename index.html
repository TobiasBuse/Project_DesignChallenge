            <p class="section3p lineheight">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
                improve <br> my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing <br> some ideas
                that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell <br> phone, I decided to look for some
                challenge, something that makes more <br> sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers
                (especially in dribbble) <br>made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
                tha <br> the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
